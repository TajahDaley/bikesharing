# Bike Sharing 
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether having bike sharing in Iowa is worth it. With NYC being one of the biggest Metro areas in the US having multiple forms of public transportation is very important. With the data given to us it is a no brainer that the bicycles will be a very great idea. 

## Results

Looking at the data here it shows us how many bikes are in use throughout the day and by which Gender as well. The 3rd gender is "Unknown" assuming some people did not leave their gender. But you can clearly see that there is a high usage of bikes during the times of 4am -8am. Most likely when people are on their way to work or wherever.

One thing this picture shows us is the trips taken by gender throughout the week. The darker areas show more people on the bikes during those times.

This photo shows two things one of them being a simple breakdown of the genders that were used in this study. The second thing is a heatmap of the starting location for the bike rides.

Looking at this one it shows us how many Subscribers and/or Customers are at starting and/or ending their bike rides at specific locations. This is great to know so that we can see if we need more or less bikes in specific areas.

Lastly this one is able to show a small breakdown of how many customers and subscribers there are by gender. This shows us there are more male than female bike riders. This other small graph shows us how many people (Male, Female and Unknown) who are a subscriber or customer and the start time for them throughout the week. 

## Summary
With the data set given to us there are plenty of other visualizations we could have looked at. Especially with such a huge city like NYC it gives us more than enough information. One thing to look at is the bike Usage of some of these bikes.

Looking at this it shows us all the bikes and how often they are used meaning we know which ones we need to pay more attention to maintenance wise. Another thing for us to look at is in a weeks time the start time for the different genders.

Although its surprising to me to see so many people using bikes so late at nights and early in the morning, but this shows us that Bikes are constantly being used so having a large fleet of bikes will be beneficial to the cities.
